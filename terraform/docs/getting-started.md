description: What is CI/CD pipeline?
---

A continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software or infrastructure. CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software or infrastructure delivery throughout the development life cycle via automation.

By automating CI/CD throughout development, testing, production, and monitoring phases of the development lifecycle, the teams are able to develop higher quality code, faster and more securely. Although itâ€™s possible to manually execute each of the steps of a CI/CD pipeline, the true value of CI/CD pipelines is realized through automation.

Can we have pipelines for software or infrastructure, basically It has a same concept:
"a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software or infrastructure."

What difer them one has stepes to create infrastructure and other has a steps for to do build and deploy software.

For infrastructure pipelines we adopt the [atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/blog/2017/introducing-atlantis.html).

For pipelines we adopt the [atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/blog/2017/introducing-atlantis.html). Already software pipelines we adopt [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).
